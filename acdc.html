      <p id="desc">
        AC/DC are an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1973 by
        Scottish-born brothers Malcolm and Angus Young.Their music has been
        variously described as hard rock, blues rock, and heavy metal, but the
        band themselves call it simply "rock and roll".<br />
        <br />AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their
        first album, 1975's High Voltage. Membership subsequently stabilised
        around the Young brothers, singer Bon Scott, drummer Phil Rudd, and
        bassist Mark Evans. Evans was fired from the band in 1977 and replaced
        by Cliff Williams, who has appeared on every AC/DC album since 1978's
        Powerage. In February 1980, about seven months after the release of
        their breakthrough album Highway to Hell, Scott died of acute alcohol
        poisoning after a night of heavy drinking. AC/DC considered disbanding,
        but at Scott's family's request, the remaining members opted to continue
        the band, bringing in longtime Geordie vocalist Brian Johnson as Scott's
        replacement. Later that year, the band released their first album with
        Johnson, Back in Black, which was dedicated to Scott's memory. The album
        launched AC/DC to new heights of success and became one of the best
        selling albums of all time.<br />
        <br />The band's eighth studio album, For Those About to Rock We Salute
        You (1981), was their first album to reach number one in the United
        States. Prior to the release of their next album, Flick of the Switch
        (1983), Rudd left the band and was replaced by Simon Wright, being in
        turn replaced by Chris Slade in 1989. The band experienced a commercial
        resurgence in the early nineties with the release of their twelfth
        studio album The Razors Edge (1990); it was their only album to feature
        Slade, who was replaced by the returning Rudd in 1994. Rudd has since
        recorded five more albums with the band, starting with, and including,
        Ballbreaker (1995). Their fifteenth studio album Black Ice was the
        second-highest-selling album of 2008, and their biggest chart hit since
        For Those About to Rock, eventually reaching No.1 worldwide.<br />
        <br />The band's line-up remained the same for twenty years, until 2014
        with Malcolm Young's retirement due to early-onset dementia (he died in
        2017) and Rudd's legal troubles. Malcolm was replaced by his nephew
        Stevie Young, who debuted on AC/DC's 2014 album Rock or Bust, and on its
        accompanying tour, previous drummer Chris Slade filled in for Rudd. In
        2016, Johnson was advised to stop touring due to worsening hearing loss.
        Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose stepped in as the band's vocalist for
        the remainder of that year's dates. Long-term bass player and background
        vocalist Cliff Williams retired from AC/DC at the end of the Rock or
        Bust tour in 2016 and the group entered a four-year hiatus. A reunion of
        the Rock or Bust lineup was announced in September 2020 and the band's
        seventeenth studio album Power Up was released two months later.<br />
        <br />AC/DC have sold more than 200 million records worldwide, including
        75 million albums in the United States, making them the
        ninth-highest-selling artist in the United States and the
        16th-best-selling artist worldwide. Back in Black has sold an estimated
        50 million units worldwide, making it the second-highest-selling album
        by any artist, and the highest-selling album by any band. The album has
        sold 25 million units in the US, where it is the fourth highest-selling
        album of all time. AC/DC were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of
        Fame on 10 March 2003. AC/DC ranked fourth on VH1's list of the "100
        Greatest Artists of Hard Rock" and were named the seventh "Greatest
        Heavy Metal Band of All Time" by MTV. In 2004, AC/DC ranked No. 72 on
        the Rolling Stone list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time".
        Producer Rick Rubin, who wrote an essay on the band for the Rolling
        Stone list, referred to AC/DC as "the greatest rock and roll band of all
        time". In 2010, VH1 ranked AC/DC number 23 in its list of the "100
        Greatest Artists of All Time".
