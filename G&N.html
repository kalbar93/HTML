        <h3 id="name-bg">Band History</h3>
        <p id="desc">
          Guns N' Roses is an American hard rock band from Los Angeles,
          California, formed in 1985. When they signed to Geffen Records in
          1986, the band comprised vocalist Axl Rose, lead guitarist Slash,
          rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin, bassist Duff McKagan, and drummer
          Steven Adler. The current lineup consists of Rose, Slash, McKagan,
          guitarist Richard Fortus, drummer Frank Ferrer and keyboardists Dizzy
          Reed and Melissa Reese.<br />
          <br />Guns N' Roses' debut album, Appetite for Destruction (1987),
          reached number one on the Billboard 200 a year after its release, on
          the strength of the top 10 singles "Welcome to the Jungle", "Paradise
          City", and "Sweet Child o' Mine", the band's only single to reach
          number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The album has sold approximately
          30 million copies worldwide, including 18 million units in the United
          States, making it the country's bestselling debut album and
          eleventh-bestselling album. Their next studio album, G N' R Lies
          (1988), reached number two on the Billboard 200, sold ten million
          copies worldwide (including five million in the U.S.), and included
          the top 5 hit "Patience". Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion
          II, recorded simultaneously and released in 1991, debuted at number
          two and number one on the Billboard 200 respectively and have sold a
          combined 35 million copies worldwide (including 14 million units in
          the U.S.). The Illusion albums included the lead single "You Could Be
          Mine", covers of "Live and Let Die" and "Knockin' on Heaven's Door",
          and a trilogy of ballads ("Don't Cry", "November Rain", and
          "Estranged"), which featured notably high-budget music videos. The
          records were supported by the Use Your Illusion Tour, a world tour
          that lasted from 1991 to 1993. The covers album "The Spaghetti
          Incident?" (1993) was the last studio album to feature Slash and
          McKagan before their initial departure.<br />
          <br />Work on a follow-up album stalled due to creative differences
          between band members; by 1998 only Rose and Reed remained from the
          Illusion-era lineup. Rose, wanting to expand the band's sound with
          industrial and electronic elements, enrolled an eclectic lineup of
          musicians, including punk bassist Tommy Stinson, virtuoso guitarist
          Buckethead, synth player Chris Pitman and several touring members of
          Nine Inch Nails, among others. After a decade of work, Guns N' Roses's
          long-awaited sixth studio album, Chinese Democracy (2008), was
          released, featuring the title track as lead single. At an estimated
          $14 million in production costs, it is the most expensive rock album
          in history. It debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, but
          undersold industry expectations despite a mostly positive critical
          reception. Following the expansive Chinese Democracy Tour, Slash and
          McKagan rejoined the band in 2016 for the Not in This Lifetime...
          Tour, which became the third-highest-grossing concert tour on record,
          grossing over $584 million by its conclusion in 2019.<br />
          <br />In their early years, the band's hedonism and rebelliousness
          drew comparisons to the early Rolling Stones and earned them the
          nickname "the most dangerous band in the world". The band's classic
          lineup, along with later members Reed and drummer Matt Sorum, was
          inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, its first year
          of eligibility. Guns N' Roses have sold more than 100 million records
          worldwide, including 45 million in the United States, making them one
          of the best-selling acts in history.<br />
