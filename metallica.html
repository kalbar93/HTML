        <h3 id="name-bg">Band History</h3>
        <p id="desc">
          Metallica is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981
          in Los Angeles by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars
          Ulrich and has been based in San Francisco for most of its
          career.[1][2] The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive
          musicianship made them one of the founding "big four" bands of thrash
          metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax, and Slayer. Metallica's current
          lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and
          Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, and bassist Robert
          Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine (who formed Megadeth after being
          fired from the band) and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton, and
          Jason Newsted are former members of the band.<br />
          <br />Metallica first found commercial success with the release of its
          third album, Master of Puppets (1986), cited as one of the heaviest
          metal albums and the band's best work. The band's next album, ...And
          Justice for All (1988), gave Metallica its first Grammy Award
          nomination. Their self titled fifth album, Metallica (1991), was the
          band's first not to root predominantly in thrash metal. It appealed to
          a more mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial success
          and selling over 16 million copies in the United States to date;
          making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. After
          experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent
          releases, Metallica returned to its thrash metal roots with the
          release of its ninth album, Death Magnetic (2008), which drew similar
          praise to that of the band's earlier albums. The band's most recent
          album is Hardwired... to Self-Destruct (2016).<br />
          <br />In 2000, Metallica led the case against the peer-to-peer file
          sharing service Napster, in which the band and several other artists
          filed lawsuits against the service for sharing their
          copyright-protected material without consent, eventually reaching a
          settlement. Metallica was the subject of the acclaimed 2004
          documentary film Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, which documented the
          troubled production of the band's eighth album, St. Anger (2003), and
          the internal struggles within the band at the time. In 2009, Metallica
          was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band co-wrote
          the screenplay for and starred alongside Dane DeHaan in the 2013
          concert film Metallica: Through the Never, in which the band performed
          live against a fictional thriller storyline.<br />
          <br />Metallica has released ten studio albums, four live albums,
          twelve video albums, a cover album, two extended plays, 37 singles and
          39 music videos. The band has won nine Grammy Awards from 23
          nominations, and its last six studio albums (beginning with Metallica)
          have consecutively debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.
          Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of
          all time, having sold over 125 million albums worldwide as of 2018.[3]
          Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time
          by magazines such as Rolling Stone, which ranked them at no. 61 on its
          100 Greatest Artists of All Time list.[4] As of 2017, Metallica is the
          third best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking
          sales in 1991,[5] selling a total of 58 million albums in the United
          States.<br />
