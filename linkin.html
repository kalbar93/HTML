        <h3 id="name-bg">Band History</h3>
        <p id="desc">
          Linkin Park is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California.
          The band's current lineup comprises vocalist/rhythm
          guitarist/keyboardist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson,
          bassist Dave Farrell, DJ/turntablist Joe Hahn and drummer Rob Bourdon,
          all of whom are founding members. Vocalists Mark Wakefield and Chester
          Bennington are former members of the band. Categorized as alternative
          rock, Linkin Park's earlier music spanned a fusion of heavy metal and
          hip hop, while their later music features more electronica and pop
          elements.<br />
          <br />Formed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with
          their debut studio album, Hybrid Theory (2000), which became certified
          Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
          Released during the peak of the nu metal scene, the album's singles'
          heavy airplay on MTV led the singles "One Step Closer", "Crawling" and
          "In the End" all to chart highly on the US Mainstream Rock chart. The
          lattermost also crossed over to the nation's Billboard Hot 100.[1]
          Their second album, Meteora (2003), continued the band's success.[2]
          The band explored experimental sounds on their third album, Minutes to
          Midnight (2007).[3] By the end of the decade, Linkin Park was among
          the most successful and popular rock acts.<br />
          <br />The band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types
          on their fourth album, A Thousand Suns (2010), layering their music
          with more electronic sounds. The band's fifth album, Living Things
          (2012), combined musical elements from all of their previous records.
          Their sixth album, The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a heavier
          rock sound, and their seventh album, One More Light (2017), was their
          first pop-oriented record. Linkin Park went on a hiatus when longtime
          lead vocalist Bennington committed suicide in July 2017. In April
          2022, Shinoda revealed the band was neither working on new music nor
          planning on touring for the foreseeable future.<br />
          <br />Linkin Park is among the best-selling bands of the 21st century
          and the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 100
          million records worldwide.[5] They have won two Grammy Awards, six
          American Music Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, four MTV Video
          Music Awards, 10 MTV Europe Music Awards and three World Music Awards.
          In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music
          video era and the third-best of the new millennium. Billboard ranked
          Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade list. In 2012,
          the band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket
          Madness poll on VH1. In 2014, the band was declared as "The Biggest
          Rock Band in the World Right Now" by Kerrang!.<br />
