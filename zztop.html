        <h3 id="name-bg">Band History</h3>
        <p id="desc">
          ZZ Top is an American rock band formed in 1969 in Houston, Texas. For
          51 years, they comprised vocalist-guitarist Billy Gibbons, drummer
          Frank Beard and vocalist-bassist Dusty Hill, until Hill's death in
          2021. ZZ Top developed a signature sound based on Gibbons' blues
          guitar style and Hill and Beard's rhythm section. They are popular for
          their live performances, sly and humorous lyrics, and the matching
          appearances of Gibbons and Hill, who wore sunglasses, hats and long
          beards.<br />
          <br />ZZ Top formed after the demise of Moving Sidewalks, Gibbons'
          previous band, in 1969. Within a year, they signed with London Records
          and released ZZ Top's First Album (1971). Subsequent releases, such as
          Tres Hombres (1973) and Fandango! (1975), and the singles "La Grange"
          and "Tush", gained extensive radio airplay. By the mid-1970s, ZZ Top
          had become renowned in North America for its live act, including the
          Worldwide Texas Tour (1976— 1977), which was a critical and commercial
          success.<br />
          <br />After a hiatus, ZZ Top returned in 1979 with a new musical
          direction and image, with Gibbons and Hill wearing sunglasses and
          matching chest-length beards. With the album El Loco (1981), they
          began to experiment with synthesizers and drum machines. They
          established a more mainstream sound and gained international success
          with Eliminator (1983) and Afterburner (1985), which integrated
          influences from new wave, punk, and dance-rock. The popularity of
          these albums' music videos, including those for "Gimme All Your
          Lovin'", "Sharp Dressed Man", and "Legs", gave them mass exposure on
          television channel MTV and made them prominent artists in 1980s pop
          culture. The Afterburner tour set records for the highest-attended and
          highest-grossing concert tour of 1986.<br />
          <br />After gaining additional acclaim with the release of their tenth
          album Recycler (1990), and its accompanying tour, the group's
          experimentation continued with mixed success on the albums Antenna
          (1994), Rhythmeen (1996), XXX (1999), and Mescalero (2003). They most
          recently released La Futura (2012) and Goin' 50 (2019), a compilation
          album commemorating the band's 50th anniversary. By the time of Hill's
          death in 2021, ZZ Top had become the longest-running band with an
          unchanged lineup in the history of popular music.[1] Per Hill's
          wishes, he was replaced by their longtime guitar tech Elwood Francis
          on bass.<br />
          <br />ZZ Top has released 15 studio albums and sold an estimated 50
          million albums worldwide.[2][3] They have won three MTV Video Music
          Awards, and in 2004, the members were inducted into the Rock and Roll
          Hall of Fame. In 2015, Rolling Stone ranked Gibbons the 32nd greatest
          guitarist of all time.[4] The band members have supported campaigns
          and charities including Childline, St. Jude Children's Research
          Hospital, and a fundraiser for the Delta Blues Museum.
