        <h3 id="name-bg">Band History</h3>
        <p id="desc">
          Deep Purple are an English rock band formed in London in 1968.[3] They
          are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard
          rock,[4][5] but their musical approach has changed over the years.[6]
          Originally formed as a psychedelic rock and progressive rock band,
          they shifted to a heavier sound with their 1970 album Deep Purple in
          Rock.[7] Deep Purple, together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath,
          have been referred to as the "unholy trinity of British hard rock and
          heavy metal in the early to mid- seventies".[8] They were listed in
          the 1975 Guinness Book of World Records as "the globe's loudest band"
          for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre[9][10] and have sold
          over 100 million albums worldwide.<br />
          <br />Deep Purple have had several line-up changes and an eight-year
          hiatus (1976–1984). The 1968–1976 line-ups are commonly labelled Mark
          I, II, III and IV.[14][15] Their second and most commercially
          successful line-up consisted of Ian Gillan (vocals) and Roger Glover
          (bass), who joined founder members Jon Lord (keyboards), Ian Paice
          (drums) and Ritchie Blackmore (guitar). This line-up was active from
          1969 to 1973 and was revived from 1984 to 1989 and again from 1992 to
          1993. The band achieved more modest success in the intervening periods
          between 1968 and 1969 with the line-up including Rod Evans (lead
          vocals) and Nick Simper (bass, backing vocals), between 1974 and 1976
          with the line-up including David Coverdale (lead vocals) and Glenn
          Hughes (bass, vocals) (and Tommy Bolin replacing Blackmore in 1975),
          and between 1989 and 1992 with the line-up including Joe Lynn Turner
          (vocals). Deep Purple went through several more member changes –
          including Gillan once again rejoining in 1992, followed by Blackmore's
          second departure in the following year (he was replaced temporarily by
          Joe Satriani and then permanently by Steve Morse) – before settling on
          its longest-running lineup, which consisted of Paice, Glover, Gillan,
          Morse and keyboardist Don Airey, the latter of whom replaced Lord in
          2002. This lineup remained the same until 23 July 2022, when Morse
          announced his departure from the band.<br />
          <br />Deep Purple were ranked number 22 on VH1's Greatest Artists of
          Hard Rock programme,[16] and a poll on radio station Planet Rock
          ranked them 5th among the "most influential bands ever".[17] The band
          received the Legend Award at the 2008 World Music Awards. Deep Purple
          (specifically Blackmore, Lord, Paice, Gillan, Glover, Coverdale,
          Evans, and Hughes) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
          in 2016.<br />
          <br />After gaining additional acclaim with the release of their tenth
          album Recycler (1990), and its accompanying tour, the group's
          experimentation continued with mixed success on the albums Antenna
          (1994), Rhythmeen (1996), XXX (1999), and Mescalero (2003). They most
          recently released La Futura (2012) and Goin' 50 (2019), a compilation
          album commemorating the band's 50th anniversary. By the time of Hill's
          death in 2021, ZZ Top had become the longest-running band with an
          unchanged lineup in the history of popular music.[1] Per Hill's
          wishes, he was replaced by their longtime guitar tech Elwood Francis
          on bass.<br />
