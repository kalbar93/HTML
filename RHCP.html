        <h3 id="name-bg">Band History</h3>
        <p id="desc">
          Red Hot Chili Peppers are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles
          in 1983, comprising vocalist Anthony Kiedis, bassist Flea, drummer
          Chad Smith and guitarist John Frusciante. Their music incorporates
          elements of alternative rock, funk, punk rock, hard rock, hip hop, and
          psychedelic rock. Their eclectic range has influenced genres such as
          funk metal, rap metal, rap rock, and nu metal. With over 120 million
          records sold worldwide, Red Hot Chili Peppers are one of the
          best-selling bands of all time.[5] They are the most successful band
          in the history of alternative rock, with the records for most
          number-one singles (14), most cumulative weeks at number one (85) and
          most top-ten songs (25) on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart.[6]
          They have won six Grammy Awards, were inducted into the Rock and Roll
          Hall of Fame in 2012, and in 2022 received a star on the Hollywood
          Walk of Fame.<br />
          <br />Red Hot Chili Peppers were formed in Los Angeles by Kiedis,
          Flea, guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons. Due to
          commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the
          band's 1984 self-titled debut album, which instead featured guitarist
          Jack Sherman and drummer Cliff Martinez. Slovak rejoined for their
          second album, Freaky Styley (1985), and Irons for their third, The
          Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987). Irons left after Slovak died of a drug
          overdose in June 1988.<br />
          <br />With new recruits Frusciante and Smith, the Red Hot Chili
          Peppers recorded Mother's Milk (1989) and their first major commercial
          success, Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991). Frusciante was uncomfortable
          with their newfound popularity and left abruptly on tour in 1992.
          After a series of temporary guitarists, he was replaced by Dave
          Navarro, who appeared on the group's sixth album, One Hot Minute
          (1995). Although successful, the album failed to match the critical or
          popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Frusciante and Kiedis
          struggled with drug addiction throughout the 1990s.<br />
          <br />In 1998, following Navarro's departure, Frusciante rejoined the
          band. Their seventh album, Californication (1999), became their
          biggest commercial success, with 16 million copies sold worldwide. By
          the Way (2002) and Stadium Arcadium (2006) were also successful;
          Stadium Arcadium was their first album to reach number one on the
          Billboard 200 chart. Frusciante left again in 2009 to focus on his
          solo career; he was replaced by Josh Klinghoffer, who appeared on I'm
          with You (2011) and The Getaway (2016), before Frusciante rejoined in
          2019. They released their 12th album, Unlimited Love, in 2022. Their
          13th album, Return of the Dream Canteen, is scheduled for October.<br />
