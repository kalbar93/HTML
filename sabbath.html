      <h3 id="name-bg">Band History</h3>
      <p id="desc">
        Black Sabbath were an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1968 by
        guitarist Tony Iommi, drummer Bill Ward, bassist Geezer Butler and
        vocalist Ozzy Osbourne. They are often cited as pioneers of heavy metal
        music.[1] The band helped define the genre with releases such as Black
        Sabbath (1970), Paranoid (1970), and Master of Reality (1971). The band
        had multiple line-up changes following Osbourne's departure in 1979,
        with Iommi being the only constant member throughout its history.<br />
        <br />After previous iterations of the group called the Polka Tulk Blues
        Band and Earth, the band settled on the name Black Sabbath in 1969. They
        distinguished themselves through occult themes with horror-inspired
        lyrics and down-tuned guitars. Signing to Philips Records in November
        1969, they released their first single, "Evil Woman" in January 1970.
        Their debut album, Black Sabbath, was released the following month.
        Though it received a negative critical response, the album was a
        commercial success, leading to a follow-up record, Paranoid, later that
        year. The band's popularity grew, and by 1973's Sabbath Bloody Sabbath,
        critics were starting to respond favourably.<br />
        <br />Osbourne's excessive substance abuse led to his firing in 1979. He
        was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio. Following two
        albums with Dio, Black Sabbath endured many personnel changes in the
        1980s and 1990s that included vocalists Ian Gillan, Glenn Hughes, Ray
        Gillen and Tony Martin, as well as several drummers and bassists.
        Martin, who replaced Gillen in 1987, was the second longest serving
        vocalist and recorded three albums with Black Sabbath before his
        dismissal in 1991. That same year, Iommi and Butler were rejoined by Dio
        and drummer Vinny Appice to record Dehumanizer (1992). After two more
        studio albums with Martin, who replaced Dio in 1993, the band's original
        line-up reunited in 1997 and released a live album Reunion the following
        year; they continued to tour occasionally until 2005. Other than various
        back catalogue reissues and compilation albums, as well as the Mob
        Rules-era lineup reunited as Heaven & Hell, there was no further
        activity under the Black Sabbath name for six years. They reunited in
        2011 and released their final studio album and nineteenth overall, 13
        (2013), which features all of the original members except Ward. During
        their farewell tour, the band played their final concert in their home
        city of Birmingham on 4 February 2017.Occasional partial reunions have
        happened since, most recently when Osbourne and Iommi performed together
        at the closing ceremony of the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.<br />
        <br />Black Sabbath have sold over 70 million records worldwide as of
        2013, making them one of the most commercially successful heavy metal
        bands. Black Sabbath, together with Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin, have
        been referred to as the "unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy
        metal in the early to mid- seventies".They were ranked by MTV as the
        "Greatest Metal Band" of all time, and placed second in VH1's "100
        Greatest Artists of Hard Rock" list. Rolling Stone magazine ranked them
        number 85 on their "100 Greatest Artists of All Time". Black Sabbath
        were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 and the Rock and
        Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. They have also won two Grammy Awards for Best
        Metal Performance, and in 2019 the band were presented a Grammy Lifetime
        Achievement Award.<br />
