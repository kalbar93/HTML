        <h3 id="name-bg">Band History</h3>
        <p id="desc">
          Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970. The band
          comprised Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar,
          vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals) and John Deacon (bass). Their
          earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and
          heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional
          and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as
          arena rock and pop rock.<br />
          <br />Before forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the
          band Smile. Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to
          experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He
          joined in 1970 and suggested the name "Queen". Deacon was recruited in
          February 1971, before the band released their eponymous debut album in
          1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II,
          in 1974. Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera
          in 1975 brought them international success. The latter featured
          "Bohemian Rhapsody", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine
          weeks and helped popularise the music video format.<br />
          <br />The band's 1977 album News of the World contained "We Will Rock
          You" and "We Are the Champions", which have become anthems at sporting
          events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock
          bands in the world. "Another One Bites the Dust" from The Game (1980)
          became their best-selling single, while their 1981 compilation album
          Greatest Hits is the best-selling album in the UK and is certified
          nine times platinum in the US. Their performance at the 1985 Live Aid
          concert is ranked among the greatest in rock history by various
          publications. In August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with
          Queen at Knebworth, England. In 1991, he died of bronchopneumonia, a
          complication of AIDS. Deacon retired in 1997. Since 2004, May and
          Taylor have toured as "Queen +", with vocalists Paul Rodgers and Adam
          Lambert.<br />
          <br />Queen have been a global presence in popular culture for more
          than five decades. Estimates of their record sales range from 250
          million to 300 million, making them one of the world's best-selling
          music artists. In 1990, Queen received the Brit Award for Outstanding
          Contribution to British Music. They were inducted into the Rock and
          Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and with each member having composed hit
          singles all four were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in
          2003. In 2005 they received the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding
          Song Collection from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers,
          and Authors, and in 2018 they were presented the Grammy Lifetime
          Achievement Award.<br />
